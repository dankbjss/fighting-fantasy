# The Five Room Dungeon

## 1
Having travelled many miles over treacherous terrain, you come finally to the site of the fabled dungeon.

Carved into the south side of Mt. Bryntor you see a smooth rectangle, 6 foot high and 2 foot wide. You might call it a door save for the fact it lacks a feature vital to all portals: a handle, or any other means of opening it.

If you wish to go back home, turn to 73.
If you wish to investigate the area, turn to 42.

## 2
You jab at the solid rock with your index finger, and it is surprisingly squishy. The mouth opens, screaming "Owww!", the eyes roll around before resting on you.

The face speaks in a gravelly voice, saying: "What the hell did you do that for?"

Add 1 to your Wall Temperament score.

How do you respond?

If you wish to apologize, turn to 26.
If you wish to deflect, turn to 35.
If you wish to double down, turn to 91.

## 3
Looking back at the skeletal remains heaped on the floor, fully confident you have bested the challenges of this dungeon, you progress into the corridor.

You come to the end of the passage and are dazzled by the reflections given off by your torchlight in the chamber you enter.

All around you are heaps of gold, gems, artworks, and other such treasures. Finally, you have made it to the prize you have sought for so long.

If you wish to grab some treasure, turn to 54.
If you wish to leave the dungeon, turn to 18.

## 4
You look the face right in the eye, saying "Can't it be both?" and then wink.

A hint of red splashes across the grey stone of the face's cheeks and it says: "Oh my!"

Turn to 98.

## 5
You are a Fighter, so you look from the face to your sword and say: "Yeah. I swing it and it chops stuff."

Turn to 52.

## 6
You press the trees button first, then clouds, and finally waves. The buttons depress easily enough, but the door doesn't respond to this sequence. After a few seconds, the buttons reset with a soft click.

The entrance remains sealed. This combination doesn't match the riddle's answer.

Return to 42 and make another choice.

## 7
You say to the face: "I am here to fight monsters, solve puzzles, and claim treasure."

If your Wall Temperament score is 2 or higher, the face rolls its eyes and says: "Great, another one."

The face looks to you and asks: "Should you escape the dungeon, what do you plan to do with the spoils of your quest?"

If you wish to say you'll help others, turn to 60.
If you wish to say you'll go on a bender, turn to 74.
If you wish to say you don't know, turn to 31.

## 8
The wall says: "You seem a mostly honorable sort. I shall open up the next room to you."

You hear the scraping of stone and, turning around, you see the west wall opens up, revealing another corridor.

Behind you, the wall says: "I need to catch some shut-eye. You be careful now."

Turn to 67.

## 9
You look at the face and say: "You're a wall carving, I don't owe you jack."

The face looks you up and down and says: "You're a bag of bones - right back at you, pal."

Add 2 to your Wall Temperament score.

Turn to 98.

## 10
The door is locked, and you currently have no means of changing that.

Return to 41 and make another choice.

## 11
You uncork the bottle and drink the red liquid. It tastes of strawberries with a hint of mint. You feel a warm glow suffuse your body.

Restore 4 STAMINA points (up to your Initial score).

Turn to 69.

## 12
The wall sighs and says: "You're a bit of a knob, but I've seen worse."

You hear the scraping of stone and, turning around, you see the west wall opens up, revealing another corridor.

Behind you, the wall says: "The rest of the dungeon lies onward. Now off you fuck, I need my beauty sleep."

Turn to 67.

## 13
Shrieking "NOOOOOOOOOO!" the skeleton crumples to the ground, finally dead rather than undead.

Grabbing the key from its neck, you go over to the golden door, which now opens for you, revealing a tunnel beyond. Add "Golden Key" to your adventure sheet.

If you wish to go forth, turn to 3.
If you wish to back out, turn to 73.

## 14
The face looks you over, examining your Wizard's robes, and says: "Is that a wand in your robes or are you just pleased to see me?"

How do you respond?

If you wish to be literal, turn to 83.
If you wish to play along, turn to 4.

## 15
The knife falls to the ground, no longer animate, leaving you free to inspect the items on the table.

The table is small and of wooden construction. On top of it is a brass key and a little bottle filled with a red liquid.

You pick up the key and put it in your backpack. Add "Knife Room Key" to your adventure sheet.

If you wish to inspect the bottle, turn to 66.
If you wish to go to the door, turn to 69.

## 16
You tell the face: "Plan to use the treasure to help out my village."

The face sizes you up and says: "A most noble endeavor."

Subtract 1 from your Wall Temperament score.

Turn to 63.

## 17
You return to the village, and while most of the inhabitants think you a fool for leaving so much treasure behind in this economy, some find the tale of your exploits amusing.

Forevermore, you are known as the only person to ever come back from the five room dungeon.

Congratulations! You have completed The Five Room Dungeon adventure as a True Hero!

## 18
Looking over the treasures, you realize that no matter how many you take, they will never fill the void in your life. You turn back and walk through the dungeon.

If your Wall Temperament score is 1 or less, turn to 78.
If your Wall Temperament score is 2 or more, turn to 17.

## 19
You tell the face: "To tell the truth, I've not thought that far ahead."

The face sizes you up and says: "I can believe that."

Turn to 63.

## 20
You press the buttons in sequence: first clouds, then waves, and finally trees. 

As your finger leaves the final button, you hear a deep rumbling sound. The mountain itself seems to shudder. You hold your breath, watching as the smooth rectangle in the mountainside slowly begins to move. With the grinding of stone against stone, the door slides sideways, revealing a dark tunnel that descends beneath the mountain.

If you wish to descend into the dungeon, turn to 41.
If you wish to go back home, turn to 73.

## 21
You walk over to the door and see it is made of solid gold. A lock and handle are halfway down the right side of it.

If you wish to try the handle, turn to 10.
If you wish to inspect the sarcophagus, turn to 86.

## 22
You press the clouds button first, then trees, and finally waves. The buttons click down satisfyingly, but nothing happens. After a brief moment, they all pop back up with a dull thunk.

The mountain remains silent, the doorway unmoved. This was not the correct sequence.

Return to 42 and make another choice.

## 23
"Speaking of which, I have a job to do."

Return to 7.

## 24
You walk over to the east wall to get a closer look at the face.

The face is intricately carved and well detailed; the eyebrows are furrowed; age and experience are suggested by multiple wrinkles and scars, and a great big bushy beard covers the lower half.

Its eyes are tightly shut, and its mouth is open a fraction on the left as if it were asleep.

If you wish to shout at the face, turn to 92.
If you wish to poke its eye, turn to 2.
If you wish to caress its cheek, turn to 50.

## 25
You reach out your hand and start loading jewels and coins into your backpack.

You keep looting until you notice a tingle in your hands. Looking down, you see that the flesh starts to peel away from them.

You start to scream, but soon even your breath is taken from you, and all becomes darkness...

Eventually, you come back to consciousness to the sound of stone scraping against stone. A smidgen of light slowly eeks out above your head, revealing an opening.

Lifting your head up, you see you are in a large chamber with a golden door to the side and the face of a plucky adventurer in front of you.

With a sigh, you step out of the sarcophagus and finally understand why no one ever comes back from the five room dungeon.

Your adventure is over, but your curse has just begun.

## 26
You see the rage on the door's face and say: "I'm so sorry, to be honest, I didn't think anything would happen."

The door looks you over and says: "Yes, well, something did, but you strike me as having not encountered many talking walls before, so apology accepted."

Subtract 1 from your Wall Temperament score.

Turn to 98.

## 27
You knock on the lid of the coffin. A few moments pass with nothing happening. Then, stone screeches against stone as the lid starts to move to the side.

Out of the sarcophagus steps a skeleton with a golden key hung around its neck and a sword in hand. Its jaw starts to move, and despite its lack of lungs, it sighs, then speaks to you in a wispy voice.

It says: "So you are the latest challenger, eh? I was once just like you. It took all my power to get here."

"Don't be thinking this will be easy, mind. This sword isn't just for show," it screams as it lunges towards you.

SKELETON
SKILL: 9
STAMINA: 13

If you defeat the skeleton, turn to 13.
If you lose, your adventure ends here.

## 28
You come to the room of the talking wall, and talk for what seems an age. You find you two have a lot in common.

You decide to make something of it together, supporting one another in a dark, cruel world.

The wall informs you that the treasure was cursed, and should you have claimed any of it, you would have become the new skeleton in the sarcophagus.

The years pass. Occasionally you have to hide when some would-be adventurer comes to claim the cursed treasure. Whenever you do, you smile, knowing you have the greatest treasure of them all: true love.

Congratulations! You have completed The Five Room Dungeon adventure with the Wall Romance ending!

## 29
If you wish to sally forth into the corridor, turn to 41.
If you wish to go back home, turn to 73.

## 30
"His skeletal remains are in the room beyond. I can see you are a sweetheart, so I'm going to skip the morality test and open it up for you."

You hear the scraping of stone and, turning around, you see the west wall opens up, revealing another corridor.

Behind you, the wall says: "If you survive, maybe come back and say hi?"

Turn to 67.

## 31
You tell the face: "To tell the truth, I've not thought that far ahead."

The face sizes you up and says: "I can believe that."

Turn to 63.

## 32
You place the potion in your backpack. It may well come in handy later. Add "Potion of Healing" to your adventure sheet.

Turn to 69.

## 33
The face looks you over, noting your Rogue's equipment, and says: "Are those two daggers in your breeches or are you just pleased to see me?"

How do you respond?

If you wish to be literal, turn to 94.
If you wish to play along, turn to 4.

## 34
The table is small and of wooden construction. Resting on top of it, you see a kitchen knife, a brass key, and a glass bottle filled with red liquid.

As your hand reaches out towards the table, the knife suddenly springs to life, flying at your face!

ANIMATED KNIFE
SKILL: 8
STAMINA: 12

If you defeat the knife, turn to 15.
If you lose, your adventure ends here.

## 35
You look at the face and with a grin say: "Well if not eggs and bacon, could I interest you in some pebbles?"

The face narrows its eyes and says: "I don't care for pebbles, or your attempts at humor."

Add 1 to your Wall Temperament score.

Turn to 98.

## 97
You jab at the solid rock with your index finger, and it is surprisingly squishy. The mouth opens, screaming "Owww!", the eyes roll around before resting on you.

The face speaks in a gravelly voice, saying: "What the hell did you do that for?"

If you wish to state your business, turn to 7.
If you wish to ask about the face, turn to 55.

## 99
You walk over to the east wall to get a closer look at the face.

The face is intricately carved and well detailed; the eyebrows are furrowed; age and experience are suggested by multiple wrinkles and scars, and a great big bushy beard covers the lower half.

Add 1 to your Wall Temperament score.

Turn to 98.

## 36
Starting with trees, then waves, and finally clouds, you press each button firmly. They stay down momentarily, but then all three pop back up at once, accompanied by a faint rumbling that quickly fades.

The door doesn't budge. It seems this sequence isn't correct either.

Return to 42 and make another choice.

## 37
Having spoken to the wall, you push on deeper into the dungeon...

The passageway opens up, revealing a large chamber. In the center is a stone sarcophagus. On the east wall is a door that reflects the light of your torch in a warm gold.

If you wish to examine the sarcophagus, turn to 86.
If you wish to look at the door, turn to 21.

If you wish to put it in your backpack, turn to 32.
If you wish to drink it now, turn to 11.

## 40
You press the waves button first, followed by clouds, and then trees. Each button makes a clicking sound as you press it, but the sequence appears to be incorrect. After a moment, all three buttons pop back up simultaneously.

The door remains stubbornly closed. Perhaps another combination would work?

Return to 42 and make another choice.

## 41
The door tells you flatly: "You are, without a doubt, one of the nastiest people to have ever entered this dungeon."

The ground starts to shake beneath, and the face continues to speak: "I cannot in good faith allow you to progress any further."

Stones start falling from the ceiling. You turn to the door, but it has gone, replaced with more wall.

The face closes its eyes and says: "I'm going back to sleep. I don't like watching them get crushed."

Helpless, you claw at the wall as a rock falls onto your head, crushing you to death.

Your adventure ends here.

## 42
Taking a moment to survey the area, a patch of stone of a lighter grey than the rest of the mountain catches your eye just off to the left.

Three raised buttons adorn the top of the light grey slab, each with a different symbol carved into it: the first trees, the second waves, and the last clouds.

Beneath the drawings are carved these words: "The world was formed of three parts. Choose the order in which the parts came to be to reveal the entrance."

Which order will you press the buttons in?

To press clouds, then waves, then trees, turn to 20.

If you wish to pack in and leave the dungeon, turn to 73.
If you wish to examine the face, turn to 24.

## 44
You are a Rogue, so you look from the face to your daggers and say: "I prefer the term stiletto, but same difference."

Turn to 52.

## 45
You walk over to the door and try the key in the lock. It fits, and you turn the handle, opening the door and revealing a corridor that extends on for at least 40 feet.

If you wish to walk into the corridor, turn to 43.
If you wish to flee the dungeon in terror, turn to 73.

## 46
For many a year will tale be told of how you gave up on your epic quest, never to fulfill your destiny.

Your adventure ends here.

You tell the face: "Get me some shiny rings, few barrels of mead, and hit the brothels!"

The face sizes you up and says: "I see."

Whatever mechanism controls the door remains inactive. You'll need to try a different sequence.

## 55
You say to the wall: "I'm just exploring, but what about you - what's your story?"

The wall looks bashful and replies: "Why, no one ever asks about me. Oh my!"

"I was constructed by the mage who built this dungeon to test the morality of those who enter in."

Your scream shakes the very foundations of the chamber. The eyes of the face open blinkingly, accompanied by the sound of grinding stone.

The face speaks in a gravelly voice, saying: "Three things: first - rude! Second - do I look like I need eggs or bacon to you? Third - real fucking rude!"
