# The Five Room Dungeon

*A Fighting Fantasy-style Adventure by Daniel Kiernan*

## Introduction

Legend tells of a dungeon not far from town beneath Mt. Bryntor said to contain treasures of incalculable wealth. Incalculable not only because no one knows what the treasures are, but also because none have such wealth with which the treasures could be compared.

Chief among the dungeon's claims to fame, however, is that no one has ever retrieved the treasures contained therein. For the dungeon is filled with perilous puzzles, tyrannous traps, mighty monsters and other such alliterative dangers.

Are you brave enough to take on the challenge?

## Game Rules

### Combat
When you encounter an enemy, you must fight it as described below:

1. Roll two dice for the enemy. Add its SKILL score. This is its Attack Strength.
2. Roll two dice for yourself. Add your SKILL score. This is your Attack Strength.
3. If your Attack Strength is higher, you have wounded the enemy. Subtract 2 points from its STAMINA. If the enemy's Attack Strength is higher, it has wounded you. Subtract 2 points from your STAMINA.
4. If both Attack Strengths are the same, you have avoided each other's blows.
5. Continue steps 1-4 until either your STAMINA or the enemy's STAMINA is reduced to zero (death).

### Testing Your Luck
Sometimes you will be told to Test your Luck. To do this:

1. Roll two dice.
2. If the number rolled is equal to or less than your current LUCK score, you are Lucky.
3. If the number rolled is higher than your current LUCK score, you are Unlucky.
4. In either case, subtract 1 point from your LUCK score after each Test.

### Using Potions
You may drink a Potion of Healing at any time except during combat. Each potion restores 4 STAMINA points.

### Equipment
You begin the adventure with certain equipment based on your character type. During your quest, you may find other items. When you do, make a note of them on your Adventure Sheet.

### Wall Temperament
Throughout your adventure, you will interact with a sentient wall. Your interactions will affect the wall's temperament toward you. On your Adventure Sheet, keep track of the Wall's Temperament Score, starting at 0.

When instructed to "Add to Wall's Temperament," increase this number. When instructed to "Subtract from Wall's Temperament," decrease this number. The higher the score, the more annoyed the wall becomes with you. The wall's response to you later in the adventure depends on this score.

## Character Creation
