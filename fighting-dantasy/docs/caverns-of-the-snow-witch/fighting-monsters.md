# Fighting Monsters

Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your own strengths
and weaknesses. You have in your possession a sword and a backpack containing
provisions (food and drink) for the trip. You have been preparing for your quest
by training yourself in swordplay and exercising vigorously to build up your
stamina.

To see how effective your preparations have been, you must use the dice to
determine your initial *SKILL* and *STAMINA* scores. There is an
[Adventure Sheet](./adventure-sheet.jpg) which you may use to record the details
of an adventure. On it you will find boxes for recording your *SKILL*, *STAMINA* and
*LUCK* scores.

## Battles

You will often come across pages in the book which instruct you to fight a
creature of some sort. An option to flee may be given, but if not - or if you
choose to attack the creature anyway - you must resolve the battle as described
below.

First record the creature's *SKILL* and *STAMINA* scores in the first vacant Monster
Encounter Box on your Adventure Sheet. The scores for each creature are given in
the book each time you have an encounter.

The sequence of combat is then:

1. Roll both dice once for the creature. Add its *SKILL* This total is the
   creature's Attack Strength score.
2. Roll both dice once for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current *SKILL*
   score This total is your Attack Strength.
3. If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the creature, you have wounded
   it. Proceed to step 4, If the creature's Attack Strength is higher than it
   has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If yours both Attack Strength totals are
   the same, you have avoided each other's blows - start the next Attack Round
   from step 1 above.
4. You have wounded the creature, so subtract 2 points from its *STAMINA* score.
   You may use your *LUCK* here to do additional damage.
5. The creature has wounded you, so subtract 2 points from your own *STAMINA*
   score. Again you may use *LUCK* at this stage.
6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either the creature's or your own *STAMINA*
   scores (and your *LUCK* score if you used *LUCK*).
7. Begin the next Attack Round by returning to your current *SKILL* score and
   repeating steps 1-6. This sequence continues until the *STAMINA* score of
   either you or the creature you are fighting has been reduced to zero (death)
   .

## Escaping

On some pages you may be given the option of running away from a battle should
things be going badly for you. However, if you do run away, the creature
automatically gets in one wound on you subtract 2 *STAMINA* points as you flee.
Such is the price of cowardice. Note that you may use *LUCK* on this wound in the
normal way (seebelow). You may only Escape if that option is specifically given
to you on the page.

## Fighting More Than One Creature

If you come across more than one creature in a particular encounter the
instructions on that page will tell you how to handle the battle. Sometimes you
will treat them as a single monster; sometimes you will fight each one in turn.
