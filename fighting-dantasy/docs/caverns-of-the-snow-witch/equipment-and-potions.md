# EQUIPMENT AND POTIONS

You will start your adventure with a bare minimum of equipment, but you may find
or buy other during your travels. You are armed with a sword and are dressed in
leather armour. You have a backpack to hold your Provisions and any treasure you
may come across.

In addition, you may take one bottle of a magic potion which will aid you on 
your quest. You may choose to take a bottle of any of the following:

- A Potion of Skill - restores *SKILL* points
- A Potion of Strength - restores *STAMINA* points
- A Potion of Fortune - restores *LUCK* points and adds 1 to _Initial_ *LUCK*

These potions may be taken at any time during your adventure (except when
engaged in a Battle). Taking a measure of potion will restore *SKILL*, 
*STAMINA* or *LUCK* scores to their _Initial_ level. The Potion of Fortune
will increase your *Initial* _*LUCK*_ score by 1 point and restores to this
new level.

Each bottle of potion contains enough for _one_ measure, i.e. the characteristic
may be restored once during an adventure. Make a note on your *Adventure Sheet*
when you have used up a potion.

Remember also that you may only choose _one_ of the three potions to take on
your trip, so choose wisely!
