# HINTS ON PLAY

Your journey will be perilous and you are likely to fail on your first attempt.
Make notes and draw a map as you explore - this map will be invaluable in future
adventures and enable you to progress rapidly through to unexplored sections.

Not all areas contain treasure; many merely contain traps and creatures which
you will no doubt fall foul of. You may make wrong turnings during your quest
and while you may indeed progress through to your ultimate destination, it is by
no means certain that you will find what you are searching for.

The 'one true way' involves a minimum of risk and any player, no matter how weak
on initial dice rolls, should be able to get through fairly easily.

May the luck of the gods go with you on the adventure ahead!
