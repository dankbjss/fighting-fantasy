*SKILL*, *STAMINA* and *LUCK* scores change constantly during an adventure. 
You must keep an accurate record of these scores and for this reason you are 
advised either to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. But
never rub out your _Initial_ scores. Although you may be awarded additional 
*SKILL*, *STAMINA* and *LUCK* points, these totals may never exceed your 
_Initial_ scores except on very rare occasions, when you will be instructed 
on a particular page.

## SKILL

### Restoring Skill

Your *SKILL* score will not change much during your adventure. Occasionally, a
page may give instructions to increase or decrease your *SKILL* score. A Magic
Weapon may increase your *SKILL*, but remember that only one weapon can be used at
a time! You cannot claim 2 *SKILL* bonuses for carrying two Magic Swords. Your
*SKILL* score can never exceed its _Initial_ value. Drinking the Potion of Skill
(see later) will restore your *SKILL* to its _Initial_ level at any time.

## STAMINA

### Stamina and Provisions

Your *STAMINA* score will change a lot during your adventure as you fight monsters
and undertake arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your *STAMINA* level may be
dangerously low and battles may be particularly risky, so be careful!

Your backpack contains enough Provisions for ten meals. You may rest and eat at
any time except when engaged in a Battle. Eating a meal restores *STAMINA* points.
When you eat a meal, add 4 points to your *STAMINA* score and deduct 1 point from
your Provisions. A separate Provisions Remaining box is provided on the
*Adventure Sheet* for recording details of Provisions.

Remember that you have a long way to go, so use your Provisions wisely! 
Remember also that your *STAMINA* score may never exceed its _Initial_ value 
unless specifically instructed otherwise. Drinking the Potion of Strength will
restore your *STAMINA* to its _Initial_ level at any time.

## LUCK

At various times during your adventure, either in battles or when you come
across situations in which you could either be lucky or unlucky (details of
these are given on the pages themselves), you may call on your *LUCK* to make the
outcome more favourable. But beware! Using *LUCK* is a risky business and if you
are _un_lucky, the results could be disastrous.

The procedure for using your *LUCK* is as follows: roll two dice. If the number
rolled is equal to or less than your current *LUCK* score, you have been lucky and
the result will go in your favour. If the number rolled is higher than your
current *LUCK* score, you have been unlucky and you will be penalized.

This procedure is known as _Testing your Luck_. Each time you *Test your Luck*,
you must subtract one point from your current *LUCK* score. Thus you will soon
realize that the more you rely on your *LUCK*, the more risky this will become.

## Using Luck in Battles

On certain pages of the book you will be told to *Test your Luck* and will be
told the consequences of your being lucky or unlucky. However, in battles, you
always have the option of using your *LUCK* either to inflict a more serious wound
on a creature you have just wounded, or to minimize the effects of a wound the
creature has just inflicted on you.

**If you have just wounded the creature**: you may *Test your Luck*. If you are
Lucky, you have inflicted a severe wound and may subtract an extra 2 points
from the creature's *STAMINA* score. However, if you are Unlucky, the wound was
a mere graze and you must restore 1 point to the creature's *STAMINA* (i.e. 
instead of scoring the normal 2 points of damage, you have now scored only 1).

**If the creature has just wounded you**: you may Test Luck to try to minimize the
wound. If you are Lucky, you have managed to avoid the full damage of the blow.
Restore 1 point of *STAMINA* (i.e. instead of doing 2 points of damage it has done
only 1). If you are Unlucky, you have taken a more serious blow. Subtract 1
extra *STAMINA* point.

Remember that you must subtract 1 point from your *LUCK* score every time you
*Test your Luck*.

## Restoring Luck

Additions to your *LUCK* score are awarded through the adventure when you have
been particularly lucky. Details are given on the pages of this book. Remember
that, as with *SKILL* and *STAMINA*, your *LUCK* score may never exceed its 
_Initial_ value unless specifically instructed. Drinking the Potion of Fortune 
will restore your *LUCK* to its _Initial_ level at any time, and increase your
_Initial_  *LUCK* by 1 point.
